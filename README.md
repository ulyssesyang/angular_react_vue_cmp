# Angular1.x vs Reactjs vs Vuejs

One of main jobs of Front-end web developers is writing codes to manipulate the DOM. While simply just using some JS library like jQuery will easily lead codes in to a nested pile of JS functions which make codes hard to debug and reuse. In order to stay away from making spaghetti codes, we use modern JS frameworks to assist us to make structural, organized and re-usalbe codes in order to build up complicated web app. However, all these frameworks or libraries are only giving us better recipes for making good code, but they cann't automatically lower the difficulty of building complicated apps.
The purpose of this project is just to summarize and get deeper understanding of core features, patterns, algorithmns of these three popular frameworks.
